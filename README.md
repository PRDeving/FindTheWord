### DISCLAIM
This has been my first time coding in Lisp, thanks Victor to show me a nice language i will NOT use anymore

### HOW TO RUN
This 'game' has been written in Linux 3.19.0-25-generic and should work wherever a lisp interpreter runs.

In development has been ran with clisp

`clisp main.lisp`
